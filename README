This is a python program utilizing feed-forward neural network model to predict the handwritten digits.
The handwritten digit images are from MSINT dataset. Each digit is a 28 x 28 grey scale image 
with values range from 0 to 256. Here we represent an image as a row vector with length 784 where the 
image has been serialized into one long vector. Each digit has an associated class label from 0 ~ 9 corresponding to its value. This program will use three dataset splits, a training set named mnist_small_train.csv containing 5000 examples, a validation set named mnist_small_val.csv containing 1000 examples, and a test set named mnist_test.csv containing 4220 without labels. User could choose either sigmoid or ReLU as the activation function and could also change the other parameters as they want. 
The program will generate a file named test_predicted.csv that contains the prediction labels of the test set.

Install the numpy and matplotlib packages by using the below commands
pip install numpy 
pip install matplotlib
Use the below command to run the program
